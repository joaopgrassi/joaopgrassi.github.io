          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This page explains what visiting this site means for your online
            privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            First and foremost, online privacy is something
            <strong>very important to me</strong>. This site was built with your
            online privacy as a priority from the start. This site is entirely
            Open Source and its code can be found on
            <a href="https://github.com/joaopgrassi/blog">GitHub</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I have <strong>no interest</strong> in collecting nor
            sharing any of your data, due to technicalities <em>some</em> data
            might be transmitted. The next sections describe in detail the scope
            of such data transmission.

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              At the web server level, this happens by default by storing an IP
              address &lt;123.123.123.XXX&gt; in the log file instead of the
              visitor’s actual IP address, for example, &lt;123.123.123.123&gt;.
              The XXX is a random value between 1 and 254, so it is no longer
              possible to establish the true identity of the visitor.
